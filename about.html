    <h2>Know more About us</h2>
    <p>The "Beyond Words" is a real-time emotion detection application that utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning models to classify human emotions from audio and video sources. By creating a user-friendly Streamlit interface, capturing video frames using OpenCV, and employing a trained emotion detection model, it demonstrates the practical applications of deep learning and computer vision in human-computer interaction, emotion recognition, and related fields. By capturing the emotional essence of human interactions, the project has the potential to revolutionize the way we understand and interact with others in both virtual and real-life scenarios.</p>
